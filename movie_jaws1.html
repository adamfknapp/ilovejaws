                <p>The text on this page is taken from <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a35756/jaws-anniversary-blockbusters/">Esquire</a>. </p>
                <p> Jaws is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential American films ever made. It was the first summer blockbuster as we've come to know them, creating, more or less on its own, the business model of modern movies: wide distribution
                    combined with television ads during the summer. That system seems obvious in hindsight, but at the time it was radical. Summer used to be the dumping season for American movies, not the natural time to pay vast sums to slide into dark
                    air-conditioned rooms and watch technical spectacles. Jaws invented that form of pleasurable entertainment exactly 40 years ago this week, opening on June 20, 1975. It also launched the career of Steven Spielberg and turned sharks,
                    in the popular imagination, from fish into monsters.
                    <p>

                        <p> Nonetheless, those who watch the film, or more likely re-watch it, as it is re-released in theaters this week in honor of the anniversary, will recognize few if any attributes of the summer blockbusters that Jaws supposedly spawned.
                            Jaws is at a total remove from the endlessly repetitious Marvel features or the countless sequels of our franchise-obsessed summers. The marketing strategy it invented might still matter, but the storytelling found in Jaws
                            has more or less completely vanished. To our great loss. Jaws is so much better than what our current summer summer-movie season has produced. </p>

                <p>
                    Jaws is about a small shark (okay, small relative to the beast in Deep Blue Sea) that attacks the beaches of Amity Island. Its stakes are those merely of a few people in a small seaside town. The threat is that the town might have to shut down the beach
                    for a couple of months. No alien race is going to enslave the whole of the human race. No ring of power will determine who controls the cosmos. Spielberg apparently did not feel that the only way to get audiences to care about a story
                    was to jack the jeopardy up as high as it could go.

                <p>
                    Rather than a simple struggle between good guys and bad guys—servants of light against servants of darkness—Jaws actually tried to humanize Police Chief Martin Brody: Should he keep the beaches open after knowing about the shark or should he not? Such
                    moral complications are not possible in the big blockbusters of our moment, in which the struggle must be purified to the point where a six-year-old could understand the struggle.

                    Quoting <a href="https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2015/06/16/why-the-music-of-jaws-is-still-terrifying">Boston.com</a>. Just as the movie Jaws left a mark on the summer blockbuster, so, too, did its music. The simple yet
                    terrifying score led to a number of awards for composer John Williams, including his first of 22 Grammy Awards and second of five Academy Awards. While director Steven Spielberg now credits the music for “half of the success’’ of Jaws,
                    he was initially skeptical of the main theme when Williams first presented it to him.
