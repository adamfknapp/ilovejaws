            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> <a href="movie_jaws1.html">Jaws</a> is regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history, the father of the summer blockbuster movie and one of the first "high concept" films. Due to the film's success in advance screenings, studio executives
                decided to distribute it in a much wider release than ever before. The Omen followed suit in the summer of 1976 and then Star Wars one year later in 1977, cementing the notion for movie studios to distribute their big-release action and
                adventure pictures (commonly referred to as tentpole pictures) during the summer. Jaws is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Jaws was number 48 on American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movies, a list of the
                greatest American films of all time, dropping down to number 56 on the 10 Year Anniversary list. It was ranked second on a similar list for thrillers, 100 Years... 100 Thrills.</p>

            <p>The sequels are not held in such high regard. Many reviewers criticized Jaws 2 director Jeannot Szwarc for showing more of the shark than the first film had, reducing the Hitchcockian notion "that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen
                and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." The performances of Scheider, Gary, and Hamilton in Jaws 2 were praised. However, the teenagers, who are
                "irritating and incessantly screaming... don't make for very sympathetic victims."</p>

            <p>Reception for Jaws 3-D was generally poor. Variety calls it "tepid" and suggests that Alves "fails to linger long enough on the Great White." It has a 10% "rotten" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. The 3-D was criticized as being a gimmick to attract
                audiences to the aging series[86] and for being ineffective. Derek Winnert says that "with Richard Matheson's name on the script you'd expect a better yarn" although he continues to say that the film "is entirely watchable with a big pack
                of popcorn."</p>

            <p><a href="movie_jaws4.html">Jaws: The Revenge</a> attracted the poorest critical reception of the series and was nominated for Worst Picture in the 1987 Golden Raspberry Awards. It was rated by Entertainment Weekly as one of "The 25 Worst Sequels
                Ever Made." Roger Ebert said that it "is not simply a bad movie, but also a <strong>stupid and incompetent</strong> one." He lists several elements that he finds unbelievable including that Ellen is "haunted by flashbacks to events where
                she was not present." Ebert also laments that Michael Caine could not attend the ceremony to collect his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor earned for Hannah and Her Sisters because of his shooting commitments on this film.

                                Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw).</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody. The plot concerns Chief Brody suspecting another great white shark is terrorizing the fictional seaside resort of Amity Island, following a series of incidents and disappearances,
                                and his suspicions are eventually proven true. Plus, the shark eats a helicopter. You are not even safe in THE AIR!</p>

                            <p class="card-text"> The film follows the Brody children from the previous films at an aquatic park in Florida with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares for opening, a young great white shark infiltrates the park from the sea, seemingly
                                attacking and killing the park's employees. Once the shark is captured, however, it becomes apparent that a second, much larger shark that also entered the park was the real culprit.

                            <p class="card-text">The film focuses on a now-widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) and her conviction that a great white shark is <strong>seeking revenge on her family, particularly when it kills her son, and follows her to the Bahamas.</strong>                                Jaws: The Revenge was shot on location in New England and in the Bahamas, and completed on the Universal lot. Like the first two films, Martha's Vineyard was the location of the fictional Amity Island for the opening scenes.</p>
